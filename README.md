An implementation of Neural Style Transfer for Audio using Pytorch.
============================

This is an implementation of neural style transfer using the alogrithm developed in
[A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge.

However instead of learning style from images we use the spectrogram in place to carry out the procedure on audio.

General implementation is based off the [Pytorch tutorial on Neural Transfer](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html) by Alexis Jacq. Also inspired by [Audio texture synthesis](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/neural-style-audio-torch) by Dmitry Ulyanov.
